        OSLC Link Validity Service defines an OSLC RESTful web service API to query, assess and assert the validity
        status of links that represent some semantic dependency.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        A Link Validity Service would provide the ability for a client application to query the status of links that
        represent some semantic dependency. See OSLC Core Version 3.0. Part 7: Vocabulary section 5.2 Traceability and
        Impact type.
      </p>
      <p>
        OSLC Core describes a “link” as an RDF assertion with a subject, predicate and object. A link may or may not
        represent a dependency between the subject and object. If a change in either the subject or object of the link
        could result in the assertion becoming invalid, then OSLC considers the link a dependency. OSLC does not specify
        the semantics of such a dependency, only that it can exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impact of a change in a subject or object in a dependency could follow the link direction (all RDF
        predicates are directional), the opposite of the link direction, or both. OSLC Core uses oslc:impactType to
        allow servers to specify how changes in subjects and objects impact a dependency assertion.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Link Validity Service would provide a way of getting links that are valid, suspect or invalid, or requesting
        whether a specific link/dependency assertion is suspect or invalid. It would also have a way of allowing a
        client to assert or update link validity, or to clear suspect or invalid links assuming the dependency has been
        managed somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Link Validity Service would also provide a means to define what constitutes a change in a subject or object in
        the context of a dependency relationship. This would typically involve specifying what properties of a resource
        constitute a change in the context of a dependency. The impacting property changes could be different for the
        same resources in different dependency relationships.

      <h2>Base Requirements</h2>

      <p>
        The following sub-sections define the mandatory and optional requirements for an OSLC Architecture Management
        (OSLC AM) server.
      </p>

      <section id="baseCompliance">
        <h2>Base Compliance</h2>
        <p class="conformance">
          This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC LVS servers MUST be compliant with both the core
          specification, MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of this specification, and
          SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both these specifications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following table summarizes the requirements from OSLC Core Specification as well as some additional
          requirements specific for LVS Servers. Note that this specification further restricts some of the requirements
          from the OSLC Core Specification. See the previous sections in this specification or the OSLC Core
          Specification to get further details on each of these requirements.

                LVS Servers SHOULD provide resource paging, as defined in [OSLC-Core-3.0-Part1]. In case resource paging
                is supported, stable paging is required. Note: as the LVS server implements a post-method as defined
                below, consider that instead of using oslc:nextPage in oslc:ResponseInfo, the use of oslc:postBody is
                required.

                LVS Service URI is configured explicitly in each LVS client. Therefore no dedicated discovery protocol
                is needed. Note: a scenario with multiple LVS Servers is possible, in which case multiple LVS Service
                URI are configured. This specification does not prescribe how these multiple LVS servers are managed
                together. A LVS Service SHOULD provide discovery of its link contributors via Service Provider Catalog
                which is pointing via oslc:serviceProviderCatalog to the contributing servers catalogs.

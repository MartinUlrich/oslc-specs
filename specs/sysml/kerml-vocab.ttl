The redefinedFeature might have values for instances of the domain of the redefiningFeature, but only as instances of the domain of the redefinedFeature that happen to also be instances of the domain of the redefiningFeature. This is supported by the constraints inherited from Subsetting on the domains of the redefiningFeature and redefinedFeature. However, these constraints are narrowed for Redefinition to require the owningTypes of the redefiningFeature and redefinedFeature to be different and the redefinedFeature to not be inherited into the owningNamespace of the redefiningFeature.This enables the redefiningFeature to have the same name as the redefinedFeature, if desired." ;
